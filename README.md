# Mobile Testing Demo
This mobile probject will do the following: 
- creates a tiny iOS app in Xcode (runs in the Simulator),
- writes a simple Appium UI test in Python that opens the Simulator, taps a button and verifies label text,
- explains how to build the app for the Simulator, run Appium, run tests, and push everything to GitHub.
