# Mobile Testing Demo
This project will do the following: 
- creates a tiny iOS app in **Xcode** (runs in the Simulator),
- writes a simple **Appium** UI test in **Python** that opens the Simulator, taps a button and verifies label text,
- explains how to build the app for the Simulator, run Appium, run tests, and push everything to GitHub.
